### Transport Security
- âœ… HTTPS enforced in production
- âœ… WSS (WebSocket Secure) for real-time connections
- âœ… Helmet.js security headers
- âœ… CORS configuration with whitelist

### Authentication & Authorization
- âœ… Session-based access control

- âœ… WebSocket: 1 location update per second per user
- âœ… Protection against DoS attacks

### Input Validation
- âœ… Latitude/longitude bounds checking (-90/90, -180/180)
- âœ… Type validation for all inputs
- âœ… Sanitization of user-generated content

### Data Privacy
- âœ… No persistent storage of location data
- âœ… In-memory storage only
- âœ… Auto-deletion after 24 hours

5. **Monitor** logs for suspicious activity

### For End Users
1. **Only share** session links with trusted people
2. **Stop sharing** when done
3. **Use incognito** mode for temporary sessions
4. **Don't share** session links publicly
